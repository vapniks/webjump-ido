URL's

* Commands

 - `webjump-ido' : Jumps to a Web site from a programmable hotlist.

* Installation

Put webjump-ido.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
(you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).

Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'webjump-ido)
